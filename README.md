# IASD master optimization project

file description:
- losses.py : implementation of losses
- optim.py : implementation of ISTA algorithm
- regularization : implementation of regularization functions and proximal functions

The report is exported in a jupyter notebook, and html file, and a pdf file. For the best reading experience, choose the notebook or the html file

The data used for the project can be found in data.
Otherwise, the link to the raw data is in the report.

Everything is also accessible from my git repository https://github.com/VincentHenric/IASD_optimization.git
